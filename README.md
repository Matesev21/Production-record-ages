# Production-record-ages
This project was developed as part of my work in a company that uses Salesforce as its core system. The main goal was to adapt the functionality of generating Production Records so it could support specific age groups

## 🎯 Objective

Adapt the "Create Production Records" button in the "Kitchen Orders" module to:
- Generate records for groupe of ages that were excluded
- Provide a manual backup solution using HTML and CSS to generate the production format.


## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- Salesforce (Apex, Visualforce)
- HTML / CSS (for manual version)
- Sandbox environment for testing
- Debugging and deployment to production

## 💡 Implemented Solution

1. **Conditional logic by age group:
   Updated the backend logic so that only relevant age groups are included when generating records automatically.

2. **Manual HTML format:**  
   Designed an HTML/CSS version of the production format that can be generated manually in case the system fails.

3. **Sandbox testing:**  
   All changes were tested in a sandbox environment before being deployed to production.

## 📁 Project Status

✅ Completed and live in production
